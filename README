The code uses four libraries:
	opencv
	libgv
	pygraph
	nltk
All libraries are more or essential for code execution.
To run the code on your own Machine you will need to install
and configure all these libraries. 
Some more libraries may be added as the code development
progresses.

For implementing extractive summary, text rank algo is chosen.
The main code resides in textrank.py and is written in python.
The sample text should be in sample.txt file. Execution of code will
generate a png file showing a graph relationship of words
in sample.txt file

Please try to find any bugs or suggest improvements.
